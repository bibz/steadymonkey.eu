Surrendering to the thoughts that come to life while keyed on the computer. It is a form of meditation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enough for now, I have to figure out if this interface can appear in French too. Not that it matters so much for what I want to do.

This editor is the best I've tried so far. Oh, I can even drag-n-drop blocks. Neat â˜º!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-begin: hr--&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;!--kg-card-end: hr--&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a shame the interface is not translated.
