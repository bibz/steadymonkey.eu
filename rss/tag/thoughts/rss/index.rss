The joy of looking at a clean slate. Scary. Wondrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clean and uncluttered editor helps focus on what matters: the prose. I might come to like this. Surrendering to the thoughts that come to life while keyed on the computer. It is a form of meditation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enough for now, I have to figure out if this interface can appear in French too. Not that it matters so much for what I want to do. Who knows, I might want to advocate for this platform to non tech-savvy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, really. This editor is the best I&amp;apos;ve tried so far. Oh, I can even drag-n-drop blocks. Neat &amp;#x263A;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a shame the interface is not translated. I suppose I&amp;apos;ll just have to take the role of editor as well as publisher.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss></html>
